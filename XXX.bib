  abstract =      {Control of boil-off of cryogenic propellants is a
                   continuing technical challenge for long duration
                   space missions. Predicting phase change rates of
                   cryogenic liquids requires an accurate estimation of
                   solid-fluid interface temperature distributions in
                   regions where a contact line or a thin liquid film
                   exists. This paper described a methodology to predict
                   inner wall temperature gradients with and without
                   evaporation using discrete temperature measurements
                   on the outer wall of a container. Phase change
                   experiments with liquid hydrogen and methane in
                   cylindrical test cells of various materials and sizes
                   were conducted at the Neutron Imaging Facility at the
                   National Institute of Standards and Technology. Two
                   types of tests were conducted. The first type of
                   testing involved thermal cycling of an evacuated cell
                   (dry) and the second involved controlled phase change
                   with cryogenic liquids (wet). During both types of
                   tests, temperatures were measured using Si-diode
                   sensors mounted on the exterior surface of the test
                   cells. Heat is transferred to the test cell by
                   conduction through a helium exchange gas and through
                   the cryostat sample holder. Thermal conduction
                   through the sample holder is shown to be the dominant
                   mode with the rate of heat transfer limited by six
                   independent contact resistances. An iterative
                   methodology is employed to determine contact
                   resistances between the various components of the
                   cryostat stick insert, test cell and lid using the
                   dry test data. After the contact resistances are
                   established, inner wall temperature distributions
                   during wet tests are calculated.},
